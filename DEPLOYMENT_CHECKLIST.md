- **User Satisfaction:** Monitor feedback

## Emergency Procedures üö®

### If Bot Goes Down
1. Check system resources (CPU, memory, disk)
2. Check database connectivity
3. Review recent logs for errors
4. Restart bot service
5. Notify users of any extended downtime

### If Data Issue Detected
1. **STOP BOT IMMEDIATELY**
2. Restore from latest backup
3. Investigate root cause
4. Fix issue before restart
5. Communicate with affected users

### If Performance Issues
1. Check monitoring metrics
