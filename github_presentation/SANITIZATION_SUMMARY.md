## 🚨 Before Deployment

Anyone using this code must:

1. **Create `.env` file** from `.env.example` with their own credentials
2. **Update config.py** with their Discord server's role IDs  
3. **Replace admin user ID** in bot.py (search for `123456789012345678`)
4. **Configure Discord bot permissions** properly
5. **Test in development environment** before production deployment

## 📋 Security Checklist Completed
