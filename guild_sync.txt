GUILD SYNC COMMANDS TRACKER
============================
This file tracks which commands are synced to specific guilds instead of globally.

GUILD-SPECIFIC COMMANDS:
- news (all news-related commands) - Guild specific for better control over Twitter monitoring per server

GLOBAL COMMANDS:
- All other commands remain global for universal access across all servers

NOTES:
- Guild-specific commands only appear in servers where they're explicitly synced
- Global commands appear in all servers the bot joins
- Commands can be moved between guild/global by modifying the @app_commands decorators
- After changing sync type, bot restart required for changes to take effect

CURRENT GUILD-SPECIFIC COGS:
1. news.py - Guild-only Twitter monitoring commands
   - /news add <handle> - Add Twitter account to monitor
   - /news remove <handle> - Remove Twitter account from monitoring  
   - /news list - List all monitored Twitter accounts
   - /news setchannel <handle> <channel> - Set output channel for notifications
   - /news addfilter <word> - Add keyword filter to suppress notifications
   - /news listfilters - List all active keyword filters
   - /news removefilter <word> - Remove a keyword filter
   - /news status - Check news cog health and Twitter API status
   - /news test [handle] - Test Twitter scraping functionality

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- news.py now uses app_commands.Group instead of commands.group
- All commands decorated with @app_commands.guild_only()
- Commands must be synced to specific guilds via Discord's slash command system
- Allows server administrators to control which servers have Twitter monitoring
- Prevents accidental global news command usage across all bot servers

MIGRATION NOTES:
- Backup of original news.py saved as news_backup.py
- New implementation maintains all functionality while restricting to guild-only access
- Database and background tasks remain unchanged
- Commands now use interaction.response instead of ctx.send
