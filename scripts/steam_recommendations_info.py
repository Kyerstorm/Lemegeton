Steam Recommendations Test Script

This script demonstrates how the new /steam recommendations command works:

Features:
1. Analyzes user's Steam library and playtime data
2. Identifies preferred genres, developers, publishers, and tags
3. Generates personalized recommendations based on library analysis
4. Provides interactive UI with pagination and refresh functionality
5. Shows detailed game information with pricing, genres, and match reasons

Algorithm Overview:
- Focuses on games with significant playtime for preference analysis
- Uses logarithmic weighting to prevent bias toward extremely high-playtime games
- Searches Steam store for candidates matching preferred genres
- Scores recommendations based on multiple factors (genres, developers, publishers, ratings)
- Filters out already-owned games

Usage:
1. Register your Steam account: /steam register <vanity_name>
2. Get recommendations: /steam recommendations

The command will:
- Analyze your library (minimum 3 games required)
- Generate up to 12 personalized recommendations
- Present them in an interactive interface with:
  * Previous/Next navigation
  * Direct Steam store links
  * Refresh button for new recommendations
  * Detailed match explanations

Example Analysis:
If you play a lot of:
- RPGs (Skyrim, Witcher 3, etc.)
- Games by CD Projekt RED
- Games with "Single-player" tag

You might get recommended:
- Other high-rated RPGs
- Games by similar developers
- Games with matching features/tags
